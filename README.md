# Java Concurrency Toolkit
- A curated collection of Java concurrency patterns, utilities, and hands-on examples designed to simplify multithreaded programming. 
- This toolkit demonstrates real-world solutions to classic concurrency problems using Java's core concurrency APIs like synchronized, Lock, Semaphore, ExecutorService, and more.

# Key Features

- Rate limiting (Fixed Window algorithm)
- Dining Philosophers problem (deadlock avoidance)
- Ordered execution (e.g., Foo - print first, second, third)
- ThreadPool and ExecutorService demonstrations
- Semaphore-based thread coordination
- Best practices for avoiding deadlocks and race conditions

# Ideal For:

- Developers learning Java concurrency
- Interview preparation for multithreading concepts
- Building reusable concurrency utilities
